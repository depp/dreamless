Face it kid, no one comes out of here alive.

You can see me?

Don't mind me, I'm just your imaginary friend.  Let's get out of here.

-----

I need you to tell me one thing: what are you afraid of?

I was once like you, but I've been here too long.

Have you seen my body anywhere?  I haven't seen it in years.  Maybe later, we might find it.

-----

They have lost their dreams.

It's a natural part of growing up.

It will happen to you too one day, but you are still just a child.

-----

I'm beginning to think that your parents have moved on.

Sorry, sometimes I can be a bit blunt with the truth.

I was hoping if you could find my body, I could finally leave.

-----

I took their dreams too, but I'm still hungry.

We're getting closer.  I'll be free at last.  And you can home to your parents.

They trapped me here, with chains and locks, stone rooms and steel doors...

-----

You're finally here.  The dreamer and I, alone.

It's nothing personal, but this is the end.

I am NIGHTMARE, and the throne is mine.  Kneel before me and perish.

-----

A thousand years... came to this?

I will return!

Dream of me.
